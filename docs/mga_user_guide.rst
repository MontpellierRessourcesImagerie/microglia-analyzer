How to use the "Microglia Analyzer" widget?
===========================================

1. Get your data ready
======================

From this point, we will only consider that you are using the Napari plugin. If you are using the Python module, you can look at the "__main__" section of the "ma_worker.py" file.
This Napari plugin expects your data to respect a precise format:

* The images must be available as dissociated TIFF images (no jpg, no 3D stack, no video, ...).
* The files must have exactly 1 channel. We recommend to keep your images in 16-bits grayscale.
* All the images that you want to process at the same time must be in the same folder.
* Avoid using special characters in the folder's name. (Tips: `Doranum <https://doranum.fr/stockage-archivage/comment-nommer-fichiers_10_13143_wgqw-aa59/>`_)
* Both models used by this plugin were trained on images having a pixel size of 0.325 ¬µm, you way have troubles if your images have a different pixel size.

2. Workflow 
===========

a. Import your experiment (Media control)
----------------------------------------------

- In this section, you will import your experiment so you can visualize and analyze it.
- The :code:`Clear state` button is useless unless you just analyzed something else and need to reset the plugin.
- Use the :code:`Sources folder` to provide the path to the folder containing your images. It is the path of "my-awesome-experiment" in the previous example.
- In the drop-dowm menu below, all the images of your folder should show up. Ckicking on any of them should display it in the main viewer.
- You can adjust the contrast and brightness in the upper-left corner of Napari.


b. Calibration (Calibration)
----------------------------

- Providing measures in physical units requires the plugin to know the size of a pixel.
- Just fill the number field with the size of a pixel and select the unit in the drop-down menu next to it before clicking the :code:`Apply calibration` button.
- If you loose your image or if it becomes too small, you can click on the little "Home" button in the lower-left corner of Napari to center the view.

c. Segment the microglia (Segmentation)
----------------------------------------

+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Setting               | Description                                                                                                 |
+=======================+=============================================================================================================+
| Min area (¬µm¬≤)        | Minimal area that an object must reach to avoid being discarded.                                            |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Min probability       | The raw output of the segmentation process is a probability map that must be thresholded to create a mask.  |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- You can set the "Min area" and the "Min probability" before or after the segmentation.
- You can just click the :code:`Segment microglia` button to start the segmentation.
- The first time, the model will have to be downloaded from internet.

d. Classify the microglia (Classification)
------------------------------------------

- Click the classify button.
- The model has to be downloaded from the internet the first time you use it.
- By the end of the process, the possible classes will show up below the :code:`Classify` button, with their assoiated color.
- Some elements are classified as "garbages" (aggregated objects, out-of-focus, filaments from other slices, ...) so you can use the :code:`Show garbage` checkbox to hide them.
- At this point, you must have each microglia surounded by a colored box, representing its class.

e. Extract measures + batch (Measures)
--------------------------------------------

- If you click the :code:`Measure` button, the plugin will compute the skeleton of each non-garbage object and extract the measures mentioned in the introduction.
- A new folder named "controls" should appear in the folder containing your images. It should contain a CSV file named after your image as well as a control image.
- If everything looks fine, you can click the :code:`Run batch` button to run the whole workflow over the entire folder using the same settings you just used.
- The number of images left to process should be displayed on the button now named :code:`Stop batch`.
- By the end of the process, your "controls" folder should contain a control image for each input image, and a unique CSV file ("results.csv") aggregating the measures of all the images.
